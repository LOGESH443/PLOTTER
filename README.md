# PLOTTER
Plotter_App is an interactive Python-based command-line application that allows users to generate various types of plots using matplotlib. The app offers error handling, plot customizations, and supports different graph types like line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, pie charts, violin plots, box plots, and Gantt charts.

Features:
1) Line Plot – Customize line color and marker styles.
2) Bar Chart – Customize bar width.
3) Scatter Plot – Customize color and marker style.
4) Pie Chart – Visualize data in pie chart form with labels and percentages.
5) Violin Plot – Display the distribution of data across different levels.
6) Box Plot – Summarize data using quartiles and visualize outliers.
7) Gantt Chart (Horizontal Bar) – Visualize task schedules using start times and durations.

Error Handling:
The app includes built-in error handling to ensure users input valid data. For example:
 - X and Y values must have the same length.
 - If invalid inputs are provided, the app prompts the user to re-enter the values.

Plot Customizations:
 - For each plot type, users can input custom attributes like color, marker style, or bar width to tailor the plots to their preferences.

How to Use:
1) The user selects a plot type from the menu (1-7).
2) They input the X and Y values.
3) Optionally, they can provide custom labels for the plot title, X-axis, and Y-axis.
4) The user can also choose specific customizations like colors, markers, or bar width depending on the type of plot.
5) The graph is generated and displayed interactively.
